## Oh no, I typed 'dotnet new web' with F#!

You were told to use F# but noone gave you a path to get started right?

Well I have a [blog post entry]() just for that case! and this repository is the source code that goes hand by hand with that post.

### Run

- `dotnet run`

And start sending requests with postman/curl/whatever to

- `http://localhost:5000/`
- `http://localhost:5000/uploads`
- `http://localhost:5000/api/uploads/user-avatar`

That should show things working on nicely
